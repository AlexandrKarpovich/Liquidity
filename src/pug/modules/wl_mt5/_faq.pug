      .question-item.faq_btn_js(data-id="5")
        span How can I earn a profit from commissions?
        .question__plus
          span
          span
        .question-item_content(data-id="5") "Commissions are set and defined from a White Label checklist. This amount is the difference between Margin account equity and MetaTrader account equity. For example, the White Label decides to set $3 per lot as commission for FX (keep in mind that on MetaTrader5, lots always represent per-side volume. This means that for both sides of the operation (open and close), commission will be charged twice). This is illustrated as follows: A client of the White Label makes $10,000 profit from 700 deals at 0.5 lot each. This means that the client paid 700 x 0.5 x $3 = $1050, so his total equity change is equal to $10,000 - $1,050 = $8,950. This amount is realized and fixed into the balance of the client's account and is available for withdrawal. The client decides to make a withdrawal for the full amount of his profit: $8,950 On the Margin account, the White Label gets $10,000 resulting from client operations. The White Label makes a transfer following the client request for $8,950 and has an extra $1,050 in the Margin account as profit earned from commissions."
