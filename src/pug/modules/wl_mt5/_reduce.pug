            .reduce__title Multicurrency denominated margin account
            .reduce__subtitle Multicurrency based margin accounts allow brokers to minimize volatile risks between clients’ equity and brokers’ equity.#[span(class="db")]  Margin accounts can be denominated in any currency from the B2Broker liquidity, including cryptocurrencies. Client#[span(class="db")] accounts in different currencies which are correlated to each other can be connected to the one margin account. BNB and#[span(class="db")] BTC based accounts can easily work with BTC based margin account with minimal risk on volatility differences between#[span(class="db")] these two currencies, as an example.

In this case, brokers will work with the same amount of capital as their#[span(class="db")] clients, without risking volatility for each currency.

                    .plus__subtitle In a multicurrency denominated margin account model the broker needs to control the equity on all his margin accounts#[span(class="db")] in order to provide execution for all his clients. This means the broker has to keep more funds - close to 100% of client#[span(class="db")] funds on his margin accounts to avoid rejections for client orders due to insufficient funds.

            .reduce__subtitle The traditional scheme of brokerage with the use of a single margin account, based on the most popular#[span(class="db")] clients’ base currency. This scheme works with small volatility risks on basic fiat currencies, but has a huge#[span(class="db")] volatility risk with crypto and exotic currencies.

                    .plus__subtitle The example above contains one margin account based in US Dollars, and a lot of client groups based in different#[span(class="db")]  currencies. In this case, brokers will operate with US dollars only, but their clients have diversified portfolios which drive#[span(class="db")]  the broker to take a risk from the volatility of clients' base currencies.

                    .plus__subtitle If one client deposits with 10 BTC, the broker will cover the equity of the client by the current rate of 5000 USD per BTC =#[span(class="db")]  50000 USD on the brokers' margin account. If the client makes a profit equal to 1 BTC,  the broker will receive profit by the#[span(class="db")]  current rate of 7000 USD per BTC = 7000 USD. As a result, clients’ equity = 11 BTC by the rate of 7000 USD per BTC, equal#[span(class="db")]  to 77000 USD, and the broker has 57000 USD equity to cover the client. By the rate of 10000 USD per BTC and above, this#[span(class="db")]  difference will go up significantly.
